## Description

- Personal blog website
- user has the option of choosing light or dark mode
- all fields are checked with JavaScript to ensure all fields are filled out
- user completes all blog form input text boxes and text area
- When the user clicks "save", all input values are saved to the blogPost array in localStorage, which may contain previous object array values
- Browser calls a second web page, blog.html, which outputs the current blog post and any previous ones that have been saved to localStorage
- Functionality to toggle between light and dark mode is also on this page
- Link under blog posts provided, which takes the user to my portfolio

### Tasks completed

- created index.html, the blogpost homepage with HTML and styled with CSS
- enabled light/dark toggle switch CSS and HTML to allow user to choose between screens
- Once "save" button is clicked javascript is used to save form input values to localStorage and then redirects to the blog.html. The page loads any posts that were saved previously, if any and the current blog post. Posts are listed with newest posts on top.
- When user clicks "back" button they are redirected back to the index.html page where the form has been cleared.
